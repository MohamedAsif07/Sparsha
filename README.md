### **📂 Recommended `.gitignore` for Android Studio**
This prevents unnecessary files from being pushed to GitHub.

```
# Gradle and build files
*.iml
.gradle
/local.properties
/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/libraries
.DS_Store
/build
/captures
/output.json
```

---

### **📌 Next Steps**
- **Create a `screenshots/` folder** inside your project and add UI images.  
- **Update the GitHub links** in `README.md` before committing.  
- **Push the changes** to GitHub:  
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added README and .gitignore"
  git push origin main
  ```

🚀 **Now your project is ready for GitHub!** Let me know if you need further improvements. 😊
